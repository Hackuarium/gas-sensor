The case is designed to be cut in a 3mm-wide material, using a CNC (Computer Numerical Control) router, mounted with a 1,2mm-drill bit. Plexiglas has been used and shows relative good performances. Before cutting, drilling parameters must be set as follow:
* the outer contour of each piece must be set at "outside cut".
* all the other "holes" must be set at "inside cut"

Here are some pictures of the mounted box, without the hermetic "aquarium" in the middle.

When all the pieces are correctly obtained, one can easily assemble the case proceeding as follow:
* Glue the different parts of the aquarium together. Acrylic resine VeracrilÂ© has been used.
* Then, glue the plexiglas box directly on the chip. Assure that it is well hermetic. Silicon gun was used for ensuring absence of leaks.
* Screw the chip with the "bottom" part (the one having a round hole in each corner) using M3 screws. One can use bolts for instance to adjsut the height, as seen in the picture:

* Place both the "left" and "right" part (the ones with the linear split and the hole for the gas pipe) on each side of the chip.
* Slide the "top" part above it and between the "left" and "right" parts.
* Clip the "up" and "down" parts to the case.
