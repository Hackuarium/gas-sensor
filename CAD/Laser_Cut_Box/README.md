The box is designed to be cut with a CNC (Computer Numerical Control) router, using a drill bit of 12mm. Before cutting, drilling parameters must be set as follow:
* the outer contour of each piece must be set at "outside".
* all the small rectangle holes designed to assemble the case must be set as "on-path".
* the remaining holes (screen, alimentation, etc.) must be set as "inside".
