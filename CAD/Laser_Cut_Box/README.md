The case is designed to be cut in a 3mm-wide material, using a CNC (Computer Numerical Control) router, mounted with a 1,2mm-drill bit. The box containing the sensors should be in plexiglas for easthetic reasons, and the remaining parts are up to the user (wood or plexiglas are cheap options). Before cutting, drilling parameters must be set as follow:
* the outer contour of each piece must be set at "outside".
* all the small rectangle holes designed to assemble the case must be set as "on-path".
* the remaining holes (screen, alimentation, RJ12, gas pipe and hole above sensors) must be set as "inside".

When all the pieces are correctly obtained, one can easily assemble the case proceeding as follow:
* Screw the chip with the "bottom" part (the one having a round hole in each corner) using M3 screws.
* Place both the "left" and "right" part (the ones with the linear split and the hole for the gas pipe) on each side of the chip.
* Slide the "top" part above it and between the "left" and "right" parts.
* Clip the "up" and "down" parts to the case.
* Glue the different parts of the plexiglas box together.
* At last, glue the plexiglas box directly on the chip. Assure that it is well hermetic.

(The final version of the case which must be used is *Laser_Cut_Box_Adjusted.svg*.)
